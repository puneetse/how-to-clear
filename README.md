How to Clear
============

## What is this?

This project contains documents that describe how to create a Clear
Linux OS derivative, which is a Linux OS that uses most, or all, of
the Clear Linux OS content and organization, but differs in some way.

This project is for people who want to custom tailor the
Clear Linux OS for their personal or professional purposes,
but plan to update their content regularly with updates from
[https://clearlinux.org/](clearlinux.org).

You can make unlimited modifications to the Clear Linux OS. You
can change the organization and not the content, or you can remove
content. Adding and modifying content, and modifying the Linux kernel
are also described in this project.
